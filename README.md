I intended to solve the problem of prioritizing vaccine demographically in district level,considering the factors related as follows:

1.Demographic (urbanization, Population Density, Elderly People).<br />
2.Cold Chain Facilities(Cold Chain Points and Cold Chain Equipmentâ€™s).<br />
3.Health System(% of Population with full Immunization).<br />
4.Morbidity Patients.<br />
