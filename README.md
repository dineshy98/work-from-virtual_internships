In this study I intended to solve the problem of prioritizing vaccine demographically in district level,considering the factors like 

<p>1.Demographic (urbanization, Population Density, Elderly People)</p>
<p>2.Cold Chain Facilities(Cold Chain Points and Cold Chain Equipmentâ€™s)</p>
<p>3.Health System(% of Population with full Immunization)</p>
<p>4.Morbidity Patients</p>
